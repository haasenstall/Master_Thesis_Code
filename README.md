## Overview

This repository contains the materials, data model, and analysis code accompanying the master’s thesis _“Value Creation of Data Platforms by Facilitating Secondary Data.”_  
The thesis explores how data platforms enable value creation by supporting the **secondary use of data**, using **clinical research data** as a quantitative example.

By combining **Information Systems theory** with a **data-driven empirical study**, the work examines how **platform structures, governance mechanisms, and metadata standards** influence reuse behavior and the value derived from shared datasets.

## Abstract (Short Version)

Data platforms act as socio-technical infrastructures that transform data from static artifacts into reusable assets. This thesis investigates how platform design and governance mechanisms shape value creation through secondary data use.

Building on concepts such as **structural neutrality**, **use-agnostic design**, and **data elasticity**, the study applies a mixed-method quantitative analysis using metadata from ClinicalTrials.gov and three major data-sharing platforms (Vivli, CSDR, and YODA). Logistic and multilevel regression models were developed to identify how metadata completeness, documentation, and semantic diversity influence data reuse, operationalized as the number of requests per trial.

The results show that **enrollment size** and **hierarchical MeSH term coverage** are the strongest predictors of reuse, while metadata completeness plays a lesser role due to standardized reporting. Conceptually, the findings demonstrate that the value of data arises not from availability alone but from the **interplay of structure, governance, and interoperability** that enables reuse across contexts.
