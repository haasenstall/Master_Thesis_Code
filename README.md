## Master Thesis: Value Creation of Data Platforms by Facilitating Secondary Data - Quantitative Analysis of Clinical Trials

#### Contribution

The quantitative analysis of clinical trials and their outcome provides a deeper understanding of data platform structure for secondary use of data. This research contributes to the field of information systems by examining how platform design affects the successful outcome of a secondary data request. Specifically, whether platforms with specialized research domain or with interoperable structure across multiple topics provide higher probabilities to generate an outcome.  From a Digital Health perspective, the findings offer practical implications for the optimization of data-sharing infrastructures. By understanding the relationship between platform, data request and research output, this study supports the development of more effective, interoperable platforms that can maximize the scientific and economic value of clinical trial data. This work also contributes to meta-data modelling approaches, supports policy development in data governance and informs platform strategy theory in regulated health data environments. Ultimately, this work aims to support the design of more effective and scalable data platforms.
